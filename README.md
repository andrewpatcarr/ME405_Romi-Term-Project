This repository houses all documentation regarding our Romi project 
that was worked on throughout this quarter.

All documentation, theory and resources can be found here:

### The Project

Throughout our quarter in ME-405, we worked on labs that used our mini-car robot, Romi, in different ways. 
We parameterized our motors, implemented task-based non-blocking programming, implemented an IR line sensor, and worked with an IMU. 
All of these labs were building towards our term project/challenge.

We were tasked with completing a complex track with obstacles, quick bends and varying surface prints.

### Hardware

Our Pololu Romi has a STM-32 Nucleo with a Calpoly custom 'Shoe of Brian' along with a Polou motor driver.

Romi has two DC motor driven wheels with quadrature encoders. We mounted an IMU for orientation sensing, an IR sensor to track a black line, and a bump sensor for impact sensing.

// talk briefly about each electronic

### Programming

// talk about code style (OOP, tasks, etc.)

// talk briefly about some of the main files like PI control, IR sensor centroid stuff,
encoder stuff(maybe the AR fixing), motor controlling

// Everything should be relatively brief -- point to the documentation on sphinx for more detail,
maybe we don't even talk about the specifics of the code here and do it all on the documentation
