The Project - Romi
------------------

Throughout our quarter in ME-405, we worked on labs that used our mini-car robot, Romi, in different ways.
We parameterized our motors, implemented task-based non-blocking programming, implemented an IR line sensor,
and worked with an IMU. All of these labs were building towards our term project/challenge.
